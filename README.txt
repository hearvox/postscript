For Data-visionaries and Multi-mediators: Make posts sing with scripts and styles, all from within WordPress.

== Description ==

No more shoehorning stylesheets and JavaScripts into the post content box. No more custom code for each post. No more loading scripts on every page you just need for a few. Postscript lets you easily add libraries or single-post script and style files post-by-post.

The plugin uses the WordPress "enqueue" methods, which means you can control dependencies (when registering scripts), improve site performance by putting styles in the head and scripts in the footer, and eliminate loading multiple copies of the same library (jQuery, I'm looking at you).

= Enqueue Registered Styles and Scripts (by Handle) =

Use the Postscript meta box (Edit Post screen) to enqueue registered of styles and scripts (listed in checkboxes by handle.).

= Enqueue Unregistered Styles, Scripts, and Data Files (by URL) =

For each post, you can also enqueue unregistered files, by entering in the meta boxes text fields for:
* A stylesheet URL.
* Two JavaScript URLs, e.g, one JSON data file and one script file.

= Add Post and Body Classes =

And for each post, you can add:
* Body class(es), to the HTML `<body>` tag (requires `body_class()` in theme).
* Post class(es), to `class="post"` list (inserted by WordPress, requires `post_class()` in theme).

== Installation ==

To install the use the Postscript plugin:

1. Upload the `postscript` directory and content to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to the Setting > Postscript options screen to select allowed scripts and styles.

== Tech Notes ==

= Your Scripts and Styles =
You can register your own CSS/JS file *handles* with the [wp_register_script()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_register_script/) and the [wp_register_style()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_register_style/) functions.

Only handles you register via the [`wp_enqueue_scripts` hook])https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/wp_enqueue_scripts/} list on Postscript's Settings screen. This list also has handles registered by your active theme and plugins and the defaults registered by WordPress itself.

= Default Scripts and Styles =
WordPress registers numerous styles and scripts via its core functions: [wp_default_scripts()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_default_scripts/) and [wp_default_styles()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_default_styles/). Each file gets its own unique handle: see the [list of defaults](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_enqueue_script/#defaults).

= An Example: Thickbox =
WordPress ships with a modified [ThickBox jQuery library](https://codex.wordpress.org/Javascript_Reference/ThickBox), used to make modal lightbox windows. The [add_thickbox()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/add_thickbox/) function enables this feature, but it also loads Thickbox's CSS and JS files on every Post, whether or not the post needs it.

This plugin improves site performance by only enqueuing scripts only when speficially requested for an individual post, by checking the Thickbox Script and Styles handles in the **Postscript** box. See [the screenshots](https://wordpress.org/plugins/postscript/screenshots/).
